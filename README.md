#Wedgies

I did contract work for [Wedgies](http://wedgies.com), a company providing realtime social media polling. Their product is used by USA Today to [poll their readers](https://www.wedgies.com/question/51464117351a9602000078fa), while other users are asking [less serious questions](https://www.wedgies.com/question/51f2ba6b87ffea0200000130).

I was hired to integrate the Wedgies website functionality into a Facebook app. You can see the deployed product [here](http://apps.facebook.com/wedgiesapp).

Due to the project's proprietary codebase, I am unable to publicly post my contributions. However, Wedgies permits me to share the code in-person. If you would like to see my work, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:mcguireghs@gmail.com).

You can also view a [blog post](http://eastbayjake.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/case-study-integrating-your-website-into-a-facebook-app/) about this project's engineering challenges.

If you would like to see my code contributions to an open-source project, I am currently working on [Influence](https://github.com/ideahaven/influence).
